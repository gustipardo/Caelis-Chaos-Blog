# Motivation

Factorio has a quite a lot of items and recipes.
 Since the new things are unlocked over time, the number is manageable.
  However with Space age, there are a lot of new things you unlock, and you can start to lose track. 
  Mods have had this sort of problem for a long time, and there are also mods which help to solve it , such as FNEI and Recipe Book.

# The core of the problem

The core of the problem is the recipe tree discovery, which has 2 directions:

The first direction is discovering what do I need to craft an item. When I want to craft an inserter, I can hover the recipe to find out what I need. But maybe I don't know how electronic circuits are made, so now I have to go, and search the electronic circuit in the crafting menu, to find it and look at its own ingredients, etc.
This process is already slow and annoying, but at least it is possible.

The other direction is much worse. For example, you discover you can craft an advanced circuit, and you want to figure out the purpose of the item. This mostly means: "What do I make with this".
Answering this question is almost impossible through some kind of search now, and you just have to look through everything, or check the wiki.

The solution to this problem was clear when we already had all the necessary information in the game. All we needed to do was just aggregate the useful information in one GUI. And just like that, Factoriopedia was born.
