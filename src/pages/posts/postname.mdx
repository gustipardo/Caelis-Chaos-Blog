# title

he first direction is discovering what do I need to craft an item. 
When I want to craft an inserter, I can hover the recipe to find out what I need. But maybe I don't know how
 electronic circuits are made, so now I have to go, and search the electronic circuit in the crafting menu,
  to find it and look at its own ingredients, etc.
This process is already slow and annoying, but at least it is possible.
