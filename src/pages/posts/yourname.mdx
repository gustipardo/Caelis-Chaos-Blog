# Motivation
Factorio has a quite a lot of items and recipes. Since the new things are unlocked over time, the number is manageable. However with Space age, there are a lot of new things you unlock, and you can start to lose track. Mods have had this sort of problem for a long time, and there are also mods which help to solve it , such as FNEI and Recipe Book.

*Damage and frequency boosted for demonstration purposes.*

Ruins provide initial safe areas. Not only are some of the large structures more likely to get hit because they're big and metal, but there are some ancient alien lightning attractors dotted around that guarantee protection in a moderate radius.
