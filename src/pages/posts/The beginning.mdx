# title
Hello everyone! We are three friends from Buenos Aires, Argentina working on a RTS game called Caelis Chaos. This blog will be used to communicate our progress and information about its development. 
The game's development was started in August last year by me, Tobias. After some time, when things started taking some form and the game roughly looked like a game, two friends Gonzalo and Gustavo decided to join the development team.
Right now Gonzalo is in charge of the game's art and trailers (Yes, we already made one). Meanwhile Gustavo works on the webpage, so all of our infrastructure (Mainpage, blog, forum), depends on him. 
I'm doing the same I've doing from the start, work on the game and the engine, as this game is made in a, let's say homemade engine in C++ and SDL. Guess you could add writing blogs from now on haha.
We're all just university students so our experience doing stuff like this is next to 0, so expect everything to be very rough at the edges at the very least. This a learning journey for everyone!
Now, to what's important, the game.

Caelis Chaos is a strategy game about being the last one alive. The main gamemode is a 4 player FFA where players can interact with the battle by upgrading units and buildings, using spells or strategically throwing heroes into the battlefield.
Although this is an RTS, players lack control over units, so there's no micromanagement in here, the battles are almost completely decided by fast decision making, diplomacy and a bit of luck. Everyone starts with a Fortress where you can make
upgrades and 3 barracks, each one facing one of your opponents. From those barracks, waves of units will periodically spawn to attack the enemy on that lane. Your main base also counts with 4 towers that will provide additional defense 
when the heat of the battle reaches your front door.

Right now the game is playable, even if it looks a bit suspicious because of the use of the Windows console, I promise that will be removed on the next release. Even multiplayer should work fine, you just have to host a match and join from another instance
of the game. Your friends can then join using your IP. Everything in the game is controlled by hotkeys, because it doesn't yet have an interface, problems of making my own engine. Don't worry though, as that too will be adressed in the 0.3.0 release.
Gonzalo is also remaking every sprite in the 0.2.4 release (You can see some of the new ones on the main page) so 0.3.0 will look a lot better. Anyway, I'll talk more about 0.3.0 in the next blog, in the meantime, enjoy this trailer that Gonzalo made for 0.2.4.
See you next time!

PD: If think the wording of this post looks familiar, it is intentional. You probably know about some factory game. ;)
